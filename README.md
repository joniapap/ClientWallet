Attached please find the SQL script for the generation of the Database Schema and tables, along with the code for the Wallet  and the WalletTest project.
Kindly follow these steps:
1. Run the script to generate the DB schema.
2. Checkout and build the Wallet project.
3. Checkout and build the WalletTest project.
4. Run the tests in the WalletTest project.

The test project only includes a sample automated test for the Registration process, due to time limitations.
Further manual tests can be performed by building the WalletService.svc.cs class in the Wallet project and entering the data manually.
